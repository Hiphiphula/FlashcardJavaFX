# FlipFX

A simple Flashcard App created using javafx and SceneBuilder


## What is a Flashcard?

![App Screenshot](https://elitemedicalprep.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Guide-to-Creating-High-Yield-Flashcard-Decks-on-UWorld.png)

A flashcard is a card containing information on both sides, intended to aid in memorization. One side of the card bears a question, while the other side has the answer.

They help reinforce learning through active recall, where users attempt to answer the question or solve the problem presented before checking the answer on the other side. Flashcards can be made for many subjects, including language vocabulary, mathematical equations, scientific concepts, and historical events.


## Why we made a flashcard App?

* A flashcard app lets you study without physical cards. You can access them anytime, anywhere, making studying more convenient and efficient.
* Using a flashcard app can be a faster and more organized alternative to making flashcards from scratch. It also allows for customization, as you can choose where to store your flashcards.

### Benefit of flashcard
* Flash cards are very good at helping you remember relationships between two pieces of information
* Flash cards can increase the learning pace and help students maintain a good pace when it comes to finishing their work and improving their academic knowledge.


## Our App

When launching the flashcard application, users are presented with a main menu that has two options. The first option is to create a new flashcard deck, which allows users to create a new set of flashcards tailored to a specific topic. The second option is to display an existing flashcard deck, which allows users to review and study a previously created deck. This menu provides users with a clear and simple interface that allows them to easily navigate the application and start studying.

After choosing to create a new deck, the user will be prompted to select a location to save their newly created flashcard deck and provide a name for it. This step ensures that users can easily organize and access their flashcard decks later on. By allowing users to choose a specific location and name for their decks, the application ensures that users can seamlessly manage multiple flashcard decks for different subjects or topics, making it an efficient and user-friendly tool for studying

After completing the previous step, the user will proceed to input the question and answer for their flashcard. This process involves entering the question or prompt that the user wants to learn or memorize and providing the corresponding answer or response. By inputting the question and answer, the user creates a customized flashcard that can be used for studying, reviewing, and testing their knowledge.

If the user chooses the display flashcard option, they will be asked to select the text file (.txt) where they have previously created the flashcard deck. By choosing the appropriate file, the user can easily access and review their existing flashcard decks for study purposes. The application will then display the flashcards, allowing the user to review the questions and answers, and test their knowledge. 

**The text file format ensures that the flashcard decks can be easily shared and used across different devices and platforms.**

The app will shuffle the questions and display them to the user. When the user hovers their cursor over the question, the app will then reveal the answer. This feature allows users to review the flashcards in a randomized order, which can help improve memory retention and make the learning experience more engaging. The reveal-on-hover interaction adds an element of interactivity, encouraging users to actively recall the answer before it is displayed.
## Impact of Our Application

- **Creating an application using JavaFX can help the us in  developing our Java programming skills, understanding of object oriented programing and gain experience in creating application using java**
- **The writer can use the application as a portfolio piece to showcase their skills to potential employers or clients.**

### **Impact for *potential user*:**
- **The application can help users learn and memorize new information more efficiently, as flashcards are a well-known tool for studying and retaining information.**
 - **Users can create custom flashcards tailored to their needs, making the learning process more personalized and effective.**
 - **The application is portable and can be used anytime, anywhere, which can be particularly useful for students who need to study on the go.**
 - **The application can be a cost-effective solution for students who cannot afford expensive study materials or tutoring services.**
## What made Our Application Unique?

**The application's ability to allow users to choose a specific location and name for their decks,** not only ensures efficient management of multiple flashcard decks for different subjects or topics, but it also allows users to customize their studying experience. By having the ability to personalize the names and locations of their decks, users can easily identify and distinguish between various subjects or topics. Additionally, the application's user-friendly and simplified interface makes studying easier and more accessible, ultimately leading to more a effective learning experience.

**The app will shuffle the questions and display them to the user.** This feature ensures that users are not presented with the same questions in the same order every time they take a quiz, which could lead to memorization rather than true learning. By randomizing the order of the questions, the app helps users to engage with the content in a more meaningful way and encourages them to think critically about the material. This feature also helps to keep users from getting bored with the quiz format and provides a more dynamic learning experience. Overall, the shuffling of questions is an important feature of the app that enhances the learning process and keeps users engaged.
